What is |foxbms|?
-----------------

With |foxbms|, Fraunhofer IISB delivers the first generation of its open source battery management system (BMS) research and development platform. The |foxbms| platform is completely free and open, designed for a maximum of flexibility, and comprehensively documented. It includes all necessary hardware and software for potentially any kind of mobile and stationary application that uses modern rechargeable electrochemical energy storage systems (e.g., lithium-ion batteries, redox-flow batteries, supercapacitors):

 - |foxbms| Hardware: the schematics and the layout of all electronic boards are available for download and the design is based on commonly available components and devices, that do not require NDAs or confidentiality agreements.
 - |foxbms| Software: the software toolchain uses only own developed open source and free of charge components or free of charge third-party software, and the entire BMS source code is provided online with its own development environment and configuration files, thus enabling immediate use on Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.
 

What is |foxbms| designed for?
------------------------------

Experience gained from international research and development projects over the last 15 years in the field of electrochemical energy storage systems at Fraunhofer IISB has been implemented in the hardware and software of the |foxbms| platform. It is designed to manage high-performance prototypes of advanced and innovative lithium-ion battery systems of any size (i.e., from a few cells up to several hundreds of kWh and kW), especially for systems requiring the highest availability and safety levels.

The free and open source version of |foxbms| is not intended for immediate use in commercial products as they have to meet specific standards and require application-dependent certifications. In fact, |foxbms| is a safe research, development, and test platform providing all functions for managing the complexity and size of state-of-the-art electrochemical energy storage systems.

Specific adaptions of |foxbms| can be ordered directly from Fraunhofer IISB or can be jointly developed, for example for automotive, aviation, space, submarine, industrial, and renewable energy storage applications.
