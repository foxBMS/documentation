General Description of the |foxbms| Platform
--------------------------------------------

|foxbms| is a research and development platform aimed to be used to develop battery management systems (BMS) for rechargeable energy storage systems based on lithium-ion batteries (LIB) or comparable electrochemical rechargeable accumulator cells (e.g., other chemistries like lithium-sulfur, sodium-ion or even all-solid-state batteries), lithium-ion capacitors (LIC), electric double-layer capacitors (EDLC or supercapacitors). The lithium-ion battery packs or battery modules are a major source of hazards and are not part of the |foxbms| platform (see :numref:`fig. %s <general_information_safety_battery_system>`). The main purposes of the battery management system are charge monitoring and keeping the battery cells in their safe operating area to ensure optimal safety and the longest battery lifetime.

   |foxbms| in the battery system

For those tasks, the |foxbms| platform is equipped with measurement and control circuits (i.e., |BMS-Slaves|) to monitor the battery cells and to get information about their states. With this, the cell voltages, temperatures and overall battery pack current are measured, and kept in the safe operating area. The battery charge equalization (i.e., balancing) is controlled and fed back to the |master|. The setup of the system is shown in :numref:`fig. %s <general_information_safety_battery_system_block_diagram>`.

The |foxbms| platform uses a passive balancing circuit based on the |LTC| multicell battery monitoring integrated circuit. The unique selling point of the |foxbms| platform is its virtually unlimited possibilities to be adapted the needs of the user.



Limits of the |foxbms| Platform
-------------------------------

The |foxbms| platform consists only of the |master| with the |slaves| and the provided computer software. It does not include battery cells, battery cell models, power contactors, current sensors, fuses, chargers, power supplies, ground fault detector.

The |master| and the |slaves| have a primary and a secondary side which are separated and galvanically isolated from each other.

The area of the use of |foxbms| must be free of hazardous materials like flammable gases, combustible dust or ignitable dust and fibers. The temperature should be around 20°C and may not exceed the battery cells restrictions given by the battery cell manufacturer (e.g., around 45°C to 60°C, depending on the battery cell chemistry). The operating and storage environment needs to be dry and free of static electricity with air humidity between 35% and 55%.

The lifetime of the electronics of |foxbms| is supposed to be limited to three years since the target application is research and development. During this time, hardware and software updates and bug fixes are to be expected. Besides that, the research or work on the prototypes should be finished after three years.

The interfaces of the |master| are:

The interfaces of the |slave| are:


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 85

   * - **Connection**
     - **Description**
   * - 12 Cells
     - 13 voltage sense connections for 12 cells
   * - 8+16 Temperatures
     - Temperature sensor connection (one for each cell)
   * - 4 Daisy Chains
     - Primary and secondary daisy chain connections to the next and to the previous |BMS-Slave|

The maximum amount of BMS-Slave units depends on the number of battery cells connected to the slaves and the voltage of each cell. The total voltage of the battery pack must never exceed 1500Vdc (continuous and peak). Battery types to be used with the system are lithium-ion batteries or comparable electrochemical rechargeable accumulator cells, lithium-ion capacitors or supercapacitors.


Targetted Users of |foxbms|
---------------------------

The persons who use the |foxbms| R&D platform must be electrically skilled according to the IEC. They must also be educated in rechargeable batteries and have knowledge in electrochemistry. With the sum of battery cells exceeding 120VDC, these persons also need to be skilled in live working. It is not enough to be an electrically instructed person. Targeted users of the |foxbms| R&D platform are R&D and test engineers working in a well-defined, safe and controlled environment, like a test bay or a test bench. Since these persons assemble the whole system by themselves, they are the only persons who can do the service and the maintenance. The R&D and test engineers are both users and servicers.

The |foxbms| R&D platform is not intended to be used by ordinary persons as they are not well and not enough educated in batteries, or in electrical subjects. This also includes students, handymen, and do-it-yourselfer or DYI enthusiasts who do not fulfil the above requirements.


Intended Use of |foxbms|
------------------------

The |foxbms| R&D platform is only for lithium-ion batteries or comparable energy storage systems. It is an evaluation kit intended only to professionals and to be used at research and development facilities for such purposes. It is designed for research, development and tests purposes to manage prototypes of lithium-ion-battery systems when developing new products.


Reasonably Foreseeable Misuse of |foxbms|
-----------------------------------------

The |foxbms| R&D platform is not intended to be used as a voltage monitoring system of any other electrical systems than battery systems build with battery cells providing a maximum single cell voltage of 5V.

Hazard Zones of |foxbms|
------------------------

Only few hazard zones are obvious. One is the |foxbms| and the other its environment with the battery system including bus bars, battery cells and other parts. Since the battery system is defined by the user, only a general consideration can be done.








Risk Assessment
---------------

Depending on the countries of the target application, there are different standards to regard. In the European Union, the applicable directives lead to different safety requirements. These have a variety of risk graphs for the risk assessment. Although they are only slightly different they are not adaptable to each other. Since the target country and use of |foxbms| is unknown, the users of the system need to do a risk assessment on their own according to their concerns.

Some European directives that can be relevant for the |foxbms| users:

- General product safety
- Low voltage
- Machinery
- etc...

Some example of safety standards that might fit the application of the |foxbms| users:

Measures Through Control with |foxBMS|
--------------------------------------

- Detection of cells with over temperature and safe switch off or disconnect.
- Detection of cells with over voltage and safe shut off or disconnect.
- Detection of cells with deep discharge and safe shut off or disconnect charger.
- Detection of ground short (insulation error) with safe switch off or disconnect.
