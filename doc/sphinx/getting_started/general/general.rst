=============================
Getting Started with |foxbms|
=============================

How to use this documentation
-----------------------------

The complete |foxbms| documentation is available and maintained in HTML, PDF and EPUB formats.

.. note::
   
      A search function is available under the |foxbms| logo in the HTML version of the documentation.

How to Generate the HTML Documentation and Set up |foxbms| rapidly
------------------------------------------------------------------

First, the :ref:`getting_started_foxconda` part of the documentation explains how to install and configure the |foxconda| software used to compile the embedded software and generate the HTML documentation. Then the :ref:`getting_started_build` part explains how to get and build the sources. Finally, the :ref:`getting_started_eclipse_workspace` guide explains how to setup an Eclipse workspace to browse the |foxBMS| sources conveniently, how to supply the hardware with power and how to flash the |foxbms| firmware on |MCU0| and |MCU1| located on the |BMS-Master| in the |master|.

If these steps are done, |foxbms| already runs. The last step is longer because connectors must be made. In this last step,
it is explained how to prepare the other parts of the |foxbms| hardware.


Where Can the Layout and Schematic Files be Found?
--------------------------------------------------

The layout and schematic are available online on GitHub. Refer to the section :ref:`hardware_design_resources`.
