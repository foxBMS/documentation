The |mod_bms| contains the application running on the |BMS-Master|. It handles requests of superior control units via CAN messages and checks the system state via error flags read from the database.


Structure

:numref:`Fig. %s <bms_figure1>` shows the statemachine corresponding to the default application implemented in |foxBMS|.

   BMS state machine

In the default application, the requests made by CAN and the error flags are read from the database. If no error is detected, the |mod_bms| makes request to the |mod_contactor| and |mod_interlock| to drive the contactors. In case one or more errors are detected, a request is made to the |mod_contactor| to open the contactors.

Three states are implemented:

- ``STANBDY``
- ``NORMAL``
- ``CHARGE``

``STANDBY`` corresponds to the state where all the contactors are open. ``NORMAL`` and ``CHARGE`` correspond to a state where the contactors of one of the powerlines are closed to allow current flowing.

The ``CHARGE`` state is available only if the switch ``BS_SEPARATE_POWERLINES`` in ``embedded-software\mcu-primary\src\general\config\batterysystem_cfg.h`` is set to 1. It corresponds to the use of a separate powerline compared to the powerline used in the normal state.

The transition between the states is made in response to CAN request read fron the database. From ``STANDBY``, the state machine can transition to ``NORMAL`` or ``CHARGE``, or the opposite. No transition is possible directly between ``NORMAL`` and ``CHARGE``.

Any more complex application (e.g., that does not open the contactors immediately in case of aerospace applications) can be implemented here.

Configuration of BMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Safe Operating Area (SOA) comprising the cell voltage and temperature limits are not defined in the |mod_bms|. They can be found in the file ``embedded-software\mcu-primary\src\general\config\batterycell_cfg.h``.

The following switches are defined:

============================  =========   =========================================  ===============
NAME                          LEVEL       DESCRIPTION                                default value
============================  =========   =========================================  ===============
BMS_CAN_TIMING_TEST           user        CAN timing test enable                     TRUE
BMS_TEST_CELL_SOF_LIMITS      user        SOF limits test enable                     FALSE
============================  =========   =========================================  ===============

The IDs of the requests receivable via CAN signal are configured with:

============================  =========   =========================================  ===============
