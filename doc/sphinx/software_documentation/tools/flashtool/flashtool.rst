Flashtool
=========

The flashtool is located in ``/path/to/foxbms/tools/flashtool``.

With the command line tool, the flash memory of the foxBMS (or generally STM32F4) microcontroller can be programmed with a binary file. Also a dump read or a full erase of the flash memory can be done.

For |foxbms| a GUI-based tool is also available to automatically flash the correct flash areas. This tool is called Inari.


Module Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Source:

 - foxconda\\..

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Python modules used:
 - argparse
 - logging
 - time
 - sys
 - unittest (stm32interface)
 - serial (stm32interface)

These modules usually are included in a `foxconda` python environment.

Flash Memory Areas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Program Flash: 
* starting at 0x08000000
* variable size
* contains the whole foxbms firmware itself
* binary flash file from build process: foxbms_flash.bin

Program Header Flash
* starting at 0x080FFF00
* 256 Byte size
* contains flash area checksum and serial numbers etc.
* binary flash file from build process: foxbms_flashheader.bin

Caution: when flash programming, do not erase for each 
flash area, because the full flash memory is erased 
and everything that was written before, is erased too! 

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~

#. Connect the USB slot of the primary or secondary microcontroller to the computer.

#. Check to which serial interface it is connected (Windows: COMxx, Linux: /dev/ttyUSBx)

#. The tool must be called from the commandline:

.. code-block:: Bash

  usage: foxflasher.py [-h] [-v] [--erase] [--read] [--write] [--verify]
                     [--bytes BYTES] [--bauds BAUDS] [--port PORT]
                     [--address ADDRESS] [--goaddress GOADDRESS]
                     FIRMWARE FILE
  
  foxBMS---STM32 flash tool
  
  positional arguments:

  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -v, --verbosity       increase output verbosity
    --erase, -e           erase firmware
    --read, -r            read and store firmware

Commandline examples:

 * read 512 bytes from start address 0x08000000 to file asdf.bin when windows serial interface COM13 is connected to foxBMS ``python foxflasher.py  -r -s 512 -p COM13 asdf.bin``
 * erase flash, write and verify content of file asdf.bin at start address 0x08000100 to  when windows serial interface COM13 is connected to foxBMS ``python foxflasher.py  -e -w -v -a 0x08000100 -p COM13 asdf.bin``



For Developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Class Diagram
-------------

.. figure:: ./flashtool_classes.png
   :width: 100 %
   
STM32Interface:
- serial interface abstraction of foxBMS interface to send according to the protocol specified by ST Microelectronics

    - for detailed insight to the USART protocol refer to STM32 appnote AN3155 [1]_
    - for detailed insight to the device bootloader refer to STM32 appnote AN2606 [2]_

STM32flasher:
- easy-to-use flash tool for STM32f4 microcontrollers (similar to popular other flashtools like avrdude)

FoxFlasher:
- specific implementation of the STM32F4 microcontroller flashtool, which has following specialisations:

    - sets bootpin and resets microcontroller by the use of the serial interface DTR and RTS pins after the serial port is opened
    - TODO: read out CTS and DSR serial interface input pins to distinguish between the primary and secondary microcontroller
